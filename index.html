  <h1>Introduction: Understanding the Ladki Bahin Yojana eKYC Process</h1>
  <p>
    The <strong>Ladki Bahin Yojana</strong>, launched by the Maharashtra government, is a flagship welfare initiative aimed at ensuring financial security and empowerment for women. Under this scheme, eligible women receive monthly installments directly into their bank accounts through the <strong>Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)</strong> system. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To guarantee smooth disbursal, beneficiaries must complete an essential step known as <strong>eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer)</strong>. The eKYC process helps verify a woman’s identity using her <strong>Aadhaar number</strong> and bank credentials. Without eKYC verification, applications remain incomplete, and payments can be delayed or withheld. This guide walks you through every stage of completing your <strong>Ladki Bahin Yojana eKYC in 2025</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is eKYC and Why Is It Important?</h2>
  <p>
    The term <em>eKYC</em> refers to the electronic verification of a person’s credentials using government-approved digital databases such as Aadhaar. It eliminates the need for manual paperwork and ensures that the right person receives the benefit.  
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>✔ Confirms identity using Aadhaar-linked biometric or OTP authentication.</li>
    <li>✔ Links your bank account to your scheme record.</li>
    <li>✔ Prevents duplicate or fraudulent applications.</li>
    <li>✔ Speeds up approval and payment crediting.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Completing eKYC is mandatory for all new and existing beneficiaries of the <strong>Ladki Bahin Yojana</strong>. Even if you applied last year, you must verify your details again in 2025 to keep receiving benefits.
  </p>

  <h2>Eligibility Criteria for eKYC Verification</h2>
  <p>
    Before proceeding, ensure you meet the basic eligibility requirements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Applicant must be a permanent resident of Maharashtra.</li>
    <li>Women aged between 21 – 60 years are eligible.</li>
    <li>Applicant’s annual family income must be within the prescribed limit set by the government.</li>
    <li>A valid <strong>Aadhaar card</strong> linked to a functional bank account is required.</li>
    <li>The same mobile number used in Aadhaar should be accessible for OTP verification.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Documents Required for Ladki Bahin Yojana eKYC</h2>

  </ul>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Complete eKYC Online (2025)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Visit the official portal:</strong> Go to the <a href="https://ladakibahin.maharashtra.gov.in/" target="_blank">official Ladki Bahin Yojana website</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Locate the eKYC option:</strong> On the homepage, click on “<em>eKYC Update / Verification</em>”.</li>
    <li><strong>Enter your Aadhaar number:</strong> Input your 12-digit Aadhaar and confirm it carefully.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose verification method:</strong> Select either OTP-based or biometric authentication (if available at your nearest Seva Kendra).</li>
    <li><strong>Enter the OTP:</strong> If you chose OTP mode, enter the code received on your registered mobile number.</li>

    <li><strong>Submit and verify:</strong> After reviewing, click “Submit”. A confirmation message will display once eKYC is successful.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>How to Check Ladki Bahin Yojana eKYC Status</h2>
  <p>
    After submitting your eKYC form, it’s vital to confirm whether it has been approved. To check your eKYC or payment status:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Return to the portal homepage and click “<strong>Status Check</strong>”.</li>
    <li>Enter your Aadhaar or registration number.</li>
    <li>Verify through OTP.</li>
    <li>The dashboard will show whether your eKYC is <strong>approved, pending, or rejected</strong>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If it shows “pending,” wait for 48 – 72 hours. If it remains unchanged, re-verify your details or visit a local help center.
  </p>

  <h2>Common eKYC Problems and Fixes</h2>
  <p>
    Applicants sometimes face issues while completing the eKYC. Here are frequent problems and their solutions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OTP not received:</strong> Ensure your mobile number is linked with Aadhaar. Visit a nearby Aadhaar Seva Kendra for mobile update.</li>
    <li><strong>Name mismatch:</strong> Update your Aadhaar or bank details so that both records match exactly.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical error:</strong> Retry after clearing browser cache or use another device.</li>
    <li><strong>Bank linkage failure:</strong> Contact your bank branch to re-activate or re-link your account to Aadhaar.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Offline eKYC Option</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re unable to access the internet, you can complete eKYC offline:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visit your <strong>nearest Gram Panchayat office</strong> or <strong>Seva Kendra</strong>.</li>
    <li>Carry Aadhaar card, bank passbook, and passport photo.</li>
    <li>Officials will verify your credentials and update eKYC details in the system.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You will receive an acknowledgment slip after submission. Keep it safe for future reference.
  </p>

  <h2>How eKYC Affects Payment Release</h2>
  <p>
    Payments under the scheme are released only after successful eKYC. Once verified, your name appears in the beneficiary list, and funds are credited monthly via DBT. Missing or failed eKYC leads to delays and temporary suspension of benefits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always ensure that your bank account is operational and that the eKYC is renewed annually if instructed by the department.
  </p>
